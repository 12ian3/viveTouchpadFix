# viveTouchpadFix
A replacement part for the OG vive wand.

A few months ago, I submitted [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/l3r6jf/gauging_interest_in_a_possible_fix_for_the_og/) post on reddit to gauge interest in this part file. In the time since, I ended up purchasing Index controllers and effectivley dropping this project. I have decided to open source my file so that the community may refine the design and test it for themselves.

If you indend to print this, I believe an SLA or mSLA printer is required. I used the elegoo mars pro with good results. Additionally, I recommend the use of a tough resin such as Siraya Tech [Blu](https://siraya.tech/products/blu-by-siraya-tech-for-lcd-resin-printers-1kg) or possibly a mix of blu and [tennacious](https://siraya.tech/products/tenacious-by-siraya-tech-for-lcd-resin-printers-1kg).
